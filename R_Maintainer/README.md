# R and RStudio Installer/Updater for macOS (Homebrew-based)

This Bash script automates the installation and update process for **R** and **RStudio** on macOS systems using **Homebrew**.
Running this script will install R and RStudio
If R and RStudio are already installed, this script will update both
---

## Features

- Installs **Homebrew** if it’s not already installed.
- Installs **R** or upgrades it to the latest version.
- Installs **RStudio** via Homebrew Cask or upgrades it if already installed.
- Detects standalone RStudio apps in `/Applications` and replaces them with the Homebrew-managed version.
- This will not impact your installed packages, but the script will displays currently installed R packages with their versions after installation/update for peace of mind.

## How It Works

1. **Homebrew Check & Install:**  
   The script checks if Homebrew is installed; if not, it installs Homebrew and configures your shell environment.

2. **R Installation/Update:**  
   It installs R if missing or attempts to upgrade it if already present.

3. **RStudio Installation/Update:**  
   The script prefers managing RStudio via Homebrew Cask. If a standalone RStudio app exists in `/Applications`, it will quit and remove it, then reinstall RStudio via Homebrew.

4. **R Package Listing:**  
   After successful install/update, it lists all currently installed R packages and their versions.

## Requirements

- macOS with Terminal access
- Internet connection for downloading Homebrew, R, and RStudio

---

## Notes

- The script uses `set -euo pipefail` for safer execution and will stop on errors.
- Make sure you have permissions to install software and modify `/Applications`.
- Running this script multiple times is safe; it will only install or update as needed.
